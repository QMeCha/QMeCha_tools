Quantum MeCha (QMeCha)[^a] is a quantum Monte Carlo package started in 2017 by [Dr. Matteo Barborini](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/people/matteo-barborini/) a Research Scientist at the [HPC Platform](https://www.uni.lu/research-en/core-facilities/hpc/) of the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu), that is also the main developer of the code till now.

This repository contains some of the tools to initialize the molecular system file, the basis set and the pseudopotential.

[^a]: From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha): *``In science fiction, mecha (Japanese: メカ, Hepburn: meka) or mechs are giant robots or machines, typically depicted as piloted, humanoid walking vehicles. The term was first used in Japanese after shortening the English loanword 'mechanism' (メカニズム, mekanizumu) or 'mechanical' (メカニカル, mekanikaru), but the meaning in Japanese is more inclusive, and 'robot' (ロボット, robotto) or 'giant robot' is the narrower term.''* 

### Basis sets and pseudopotentials in QMeCha format.

The organization of the files is discussed in depth in the manual. Here we briefly recall the basic aspects.
The Basis sets and pseudopotentials contained in this repository are adjusted from the repository of [M. Burkatzki, C. Filippi and M. Dolg](http://burkatzki.com/pseudos/index.2.html) and from the [Pseudopotential Library](https://pseudopotentiallibrary.org/).

Up till now the repository contains the BFD[^1], ccECP[^2] and eCEPP[^3] pseudopotentials with the corresponding basis sets.

### Basis sets format.

**It is important to underline that all the basis sets have been reduced up to the G primitive functions. H Orbitals have been removed.**

Let us consider the cc-pVDZ basis set for the ccECP pseudopotential of the Oxygen atom.

```
The first line

```
O 5 0
```
contains the atom's name, the number of contracted orbitals in the basis set, and the number of contracted orbitals in the Jastrow basis set (which is initialized to zero in all basis set files).

Afterwards the contracted orbitals are listed in no particular order.
For each contracted orbital, the first line contains the angular momentum followed by the number of primitive functions in the contraction:
```
 S   9
```
afterwards the parameters of the contracted orbital are listed, and for each line
```
      54.7752160 -0.0012444 1G
      25.6168010  0.0107330 1G
          .           .     .
          .           .     .
          .           .     .
```
we have the exponent of the primitive orbital, the coefficient of the contraction, and the type of orbital. 
Here 1G indicates a Gaussian type orbital (GTO), 2G a GTO multiplied by the distance between the electron and the nucleus $re^{-Zr^2}$, and so on.

For the list of primitive types please check the manual.


### Pseudopotentials format.

Let us consider the ccECP pseudopotential for Oxygen
```
O 2 2
3 1
1 12.30997   6.00000
3 14.76962  73.85984
2 13.71419 -47.87600
2 13.65512  85.86406
```
In the first line we have
```
O 2 2
```
the name of the atom, the number of components in the pseudopotential and the number of core electrons that are substituted by the pseudopotential.

This is followed by a row with the number of entries
```
3 1
```
for each pseudopotential component, starting from the local term. 

Afterwards each term of the pseudopotential is listed without separations:
```
1 12.30997   6.00000
3 14.76962  73.85984
2 13.71419 -47.87600
2 13.65512  85.86406
```
On each line we have the exponent of the polynomial, the exponential factor and the coefficient of the expansion.

In this case the first three terms are associated to the local part of the pseudopotential, while the last row is related to the first non-local term.
